   ### Installation instructions 
   Run `git clone https://github.com/TheWeepingWill/Epicodus.git` 
   in a directory of choice

   `cd Epicodus` 

   `bundle install`

   ### User Instructions
   Most Projects follow a universal pattern  

   1: Cd into the directory of the desired day 

   2: Cd into the directory of the desired project

   3: Check the Project list below to see if there are any special instructions 
      for the program you are going to run. 

      A: If there are follow the instructions

      B: If not then continue to step 4

   4: Run the command `ruby lib/projectname.rb`

   This will prompt a basic user interface that will offer a brief 
   description of the project then demonstrate functionality.
