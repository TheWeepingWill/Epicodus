   1: Cd into the directory of the desired day 

   2: Cd into the directory of the desired project

   3: Check the Project list below to see if there are any specific instructions 
      for the program you are going to run 

      A: If there are follow the instructions

      B: If not then continue to step 4

   4: Run the command `ruby lib/projectname.rb`
